    The score is in the range 0 to 1. By default, there is now a fake root node added to verbs so for cases where previously a path could not be found---and None was returned---it should return a value.
    The old behavior can be achieved by setting simulate_root to be False. A score of 1 represents identity i.e. comparing a sense with itself will return 1.

Note that at this time the scores given do _not_ always agree with those given by Pedersen's Perl implementation of Wordnet Similarity.
    The LCS does not necessarily feature in the shortest path connecting the two senses, as it is by definition the common ancestor deepest in the taxonomy, not closest to the two senses. Typically, however, it will so feature. Where multiple candidates for the LCS exist, that whose shortest path to the root node is the longest will be selected. Where the LCS has multiple paths to the root, the longer path is used for the purposes of the calculation.
